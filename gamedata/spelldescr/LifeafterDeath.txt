This spell gives all friendly units a second chance to fight after dying in the battle. An affected unit that is killed will rise again as a soulless being and continue to fight. As soon as the battle ends they will collapse and return to the realm of the dead where they belong. Pretenders, undead, spiritform and inanimate beings are not affected by this spell.
