The caster sends a projection of himself to a distant land.  The projection is an ethereal replica of the caster with the same magical skills as the caster.  Items are not projected, but any path boosting magic items will still have effect.  The projection is shortlived and will only last enough for one battle.  It can only be used against hostile provinces as the projection won't last long enough to wait for any enemies to arrive in still friendly provinces.
