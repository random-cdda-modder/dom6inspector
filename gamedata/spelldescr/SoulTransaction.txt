The caster tries to buy the soul and servitude of the target with the promise to protect him from his former masters. If the persuasion is successful the target is granted invisibility by infernal forces as he tries to leave the battle. If he successfulle leaves the battle he will join his new master. The spell is difficult to resist magically, but those of strong morals are rarely affected.
