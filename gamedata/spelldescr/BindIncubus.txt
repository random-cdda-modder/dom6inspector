The caster sacrifices several blood slaves to contact and bind an Incubus, or demon lover. Incubi have the appearance of handsome naked men with leathery bat-wings. They are able to enter the dreams of women to seduce and corrupt their souls. An Incubus that successfully seduces an enemy commander will take her from her bed and fly her home to his master where he will serve until she dies. The victim of the seduction might give birth to a Cambion Progeny.
