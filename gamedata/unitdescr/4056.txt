Once the wild forests of Pyrène were haunted by sinister beings known as the Black Goats. Presiding over the Akelarre, the Akerbeltz were the true rulers of the kingdom. But times have changed. With the emergence of the Cambion, the church managed to oust the Akerbeltz and their Sorginak servants. The Cambion were encouraged to hunt down and kill Akerbeltz for sport. But there were other powers that had an interest in the Akerbeltz. Mahlat, the Red Mistress, convinced the nobles to capture the Akerbeltz for her dark purposes. The last of the Akerbeltz were coerced to crossbreed with the great mouflons of Pyrène to produce superior mounts for the Cambion nobility. The Black Goats of this age are sinister beasts bereft of magical powers, but they have an almost human intellect and are fiercely loyal to their demonic masters.
