While only the Cambion Houses interbreed with demons, some lesser noble houses that have gained the favor of one of the Cambion Houses are allowed to intermarry with the sons and daughters of the Cambion Kings. These families quickly gain influence and power, but are expected to send their demon-blooded sons to serve their patron house as squires. For years they are trained to become skilled and merciless knights in loyal service of their lord. Although their Cambion blood is diluted, they are still regarded as sacred by both the church and the downtrodden population.
