Ever since they claimed power, the lords of the first Cambion Houses have married off their children to other houses to form alliances. The Cambion Counts are sons of the Cambion Houses that have intermarried with a daughter of a lesser house, to become head of that house. While giving up their immediate control of the house the former lord of the house thus ensures that his bloodline, strengthened by Cambion blood, will live on as a lesser Cambion House. Cambion Counts, like their mothers and fathers, are physically and magically superior to mundane men, although less so than the kings themselves.
