Nott is the only Markata known to have mastered the mysteries of magic. This however, is actually not the case. Nott was once a vaetti hag of far away Vaettiheim, who left her home land in search of hidden arcana. Being denied the magic of the Jotun Gygjas she traveled wide and far to find other means to master magic. On her travels she uncovered magic not taught by the Jotun Gygjas and became skilled in a wide spectrum of magic paths. When she entered the land of the vanara she learned of their mystic traditions and the tranferral of the soul. Eager to practice her newly aquired skills she invited herself into the home of a Bandar prince and touched him with the Hand of Death in front of his entire household. As predicted she was promptly slain by his guards, but her carefully concocted plan failed. When her spirit left her mangled corpse she found that her soul was too small and would not fit in the mighty body of the slain prince. Horrified she tried to enter the body of his wife, then his guards and even his vanara servants, but her diminutive soul could not possess either of those. Desperate her fading soul searched for a vessel to possess. Out of sheer panic she entered the first body that would accomodate her little soul, a Markata that served as a pet fool in the prince's houshold. She claimed the Markata body, but the previous occupant refused to leave and hid in the depths of its former home, only to emerge from time to time to harass and fight Nott for control over the body.
Since then Nott has made herself a name as the Markata Mystic, the only Markata clever enough to master magic. Nott is familiar with the transferral of souls and if her Markata body is slain she will probably find a new one to replace it.
