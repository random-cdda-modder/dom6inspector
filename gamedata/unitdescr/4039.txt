Ever since their first contacts with Marignon the nobles of Pyrène have used horses for warfare. The lesser noble houses are supposed to field knights mounted on horses to fight for their Cambion masters. In return they can expect favors from the Cambion House they serve. The knights of Pyrène are of Bekryde descent and they have some resistance to the elements, but their horses do not.
