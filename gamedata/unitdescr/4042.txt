The Marquess is a member of the low nobility and unless able to marry off his offspring to a Cambion house, his only chance to gain influence and power is to fight for the crown. Granted lands close to the borders of the kingdom, he is supposed to raise an army and defend his lands from foreign attacks as well as prepare for a possible conquest of foreign lands. In return he might get an opportunity to marry off a daughter or son to a Cambion Noble.
