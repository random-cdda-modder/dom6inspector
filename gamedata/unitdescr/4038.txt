Pyr√®ne fields two kinds of elite infantry. The Men at Arms protect their lord and are supposed to defend and hold the line in large battles. The Swordsmen on the other hand were developed to counter heavily armored abysian infantry. While the wars with Abysia have ended there are now other opponents who don heavy plate armors. With their great swords they can maim and kill even fully armored knights.
