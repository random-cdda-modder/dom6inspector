Gorri is the first of the Cambion Kings and Mahlats offspring. His heritage has granted him infernal powers beyond those of his peers. When he was sired, Mahlat transferred the powers of the Green-Flame Emerald to him and bound his life to the Emerald, now turned red as blood, heralding the time of the Cambion. If the Crimson King is slain in his master's dominion his body will reform at the Crimson Emerald.
