Incubi, or demon lovers, have the appearance of handsome, nude men with leathery bat-like wings. They are able to enter the dreams of women to seduce and corrupt their souls. An Incubus who succeeds in seducing an enemy commander will take her from her bed and fly her to his master, where she will serve until she dies. Women of high moral standing are difficult to seduce and a high magic resistance might prevent the demon from corrupting her dreams. An Incubus who fails its attempt at dream seduction will attack the victim physically.
