Pyr√®ne was once under the influence of the Akerbeltz and the bishops of the kingdom led a bloody cult of human sacrifice and vile magics. But the religious leaders were never fully initiated in the Akelarre, and many bishops began to study and practice blood magic in private to further their influence and power. It was but a matter of time before they had found the means to summon devils from inferno. With the aid of the infernal, they gained influence and eventually engendered the Cambion Kings that would claim power over the kingdom. Under their guidance the Cambion Kings ousted the Akerbeltz and their servants. The Blood Bishops and their infernal masters are the true power behind the Cambion Throne.
The Bishops once exposed themselves to the glare of the Green-Flame Emerald, but with the birth of the first Cambion King the infernal stone lost its sheen and turned dark red. The Bishops still prostrate themselves before the Crimson Emerald upon inauguration, but the absence of the green glow has made the ceremony less consequential.
