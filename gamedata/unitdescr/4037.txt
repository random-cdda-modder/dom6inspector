The kingdom of Pyrène was once heavily influenced by Marignon and many of their military units did resemble Marignon's, but while Marignon has developed new tactics, Pyrène uses the same armaments and tactics as in earlier times. The Men at Arms are elite foot soldiers. They wear heavy chain mail armors, swords and shields and often serve as retinue and personal guard of wealthy nobles or Cambion Counts.
