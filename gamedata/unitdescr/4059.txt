Mahlat is an ancient succubus devil and the first one summoned in the kingdom. Her summoner didn't realize her true nature and unwittingly released her from the terms of her contract. Soon thereafter Mahlat struck a bargain with the highest echelons of the church. She taught the bishops the bloody rituals used to summon succubi and advised them on how to control the nobility. Mahlat herself approached one house that suited her goals in particular. She seduced the head of the house and sired Gorri, the very first of the Cambion Kings. Upon his birth she released the powers of the Green-Flame Emerald and invested him with unimaginable powers. The Emerald lost its green sheen and turned deep red, heralding a new era for the kingdom.
