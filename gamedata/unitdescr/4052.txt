Ever since they claimed power, the lords of the first Cambion Houses have married off their children to other houses to form alliances. The Cambion Countesses are daughters of the Cambion Houses that have intermarried with a son of a lesser house and become its new mistress. While giving up their immediate control of the house the former lord of the house thus ensures that his bloodline, strengthened by Cambion blood, will live on as a lesser Cambion House. Cambion Countesses, like their mothers and fathers, are physically and magically superior to mundane men, although less so than the queens themselves.
