Pyrène is not very accommodating towards strangers. Foreigners visiting Pyrène have reported that their friends have been abducted and sacrificed. This is in part true. The priests of Pyrène regularly perform blood sacrifices during mass. Foreigners, as well as natives, can find themselves apprehended, imprisoned under the local temple and prepared for an upcoming blood ceremony. During the reign of the Cambion Kings, all priests are expected to practice blood magic to further the interests of the crown and the church.
