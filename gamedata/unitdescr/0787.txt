The awakening of the Vengeful Woods has altered the very essence of Asphodel's inhabitants. No longer are white foals born in the Sacred Groves. Instead, black centaurs are born, mirroring the dark mood of the forests. The battle fury for which the white centaurs are known is further enhanced by the rage of the Vengeful woods. These black foals are trained as sacred warriors and bringers of divine wrath.
