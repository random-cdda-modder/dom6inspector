Throughout the mountains of the kingdom lie many monasteries. Once these attracted men who would study the scriptures and practice their religion in solitude. These monks are supposed to complement their religious studies with an esoteric art to increase their understanding of the divine affairs, but when the nation turned towards demon worship the monks eventually followed suit. Hidden from prying eyes the monks began practicing blood and glamour magic to sate their carnal lusts. Eventually the monasteries became nests of debauchery and sin where young nobles were able to avoid military service and political life and indulge in carnal pleasures. Few of these noble born monks have any interest in magical research.
