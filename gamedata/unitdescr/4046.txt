When the Cambion Kings emerged, the Sorginak and their Akerbeltz masters found themselves ousted by infernal powers greater than theirs. The Akelarre, the Witches Sabbath, was replaced by infernal rituals under the supervision of the church and eventually the Sorginak retreated into the wild, bereft of power and purpose. The Sorginak no longer command the respect or fear of the general populace and to most people they are just ill-tempered cat-ladies who live in the woods and curse people who approach their homes. They are no longer able to fly but they can still adopt cat shape.
