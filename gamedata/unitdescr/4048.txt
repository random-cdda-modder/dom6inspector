Pyréne is ruled by the Cambion Kings and their Queens. The Cambion are half-demon descendants of the first nobles to accept the infernal pact proposed by the priests. The lords of the noble houses were promised influence and power if they bred with succubus demons in bloody orgies. Later, when their wives and daughters were approached by the church to fulfill similar duties, the lords had already lost their souls to the infernal masters and allowed the priests to summon incubi demons to the bedrooms.
The offspring sired during these orgies were born with infernal knowledge and reached adulthood in a couple of years. Before long they had murdered their parents and usurped their positions as lords of their houses. With devil’s charms, murder and the blessings of the church they have since reshaped the kingdom into a feudal theocracy. They called themselves Kings and Queens and soon found themselves rivals for the throne. Only with the intervention of the church did they refrain from openly murdering one another.
The Cambion Kings are innately skilled in magic and are far superior to humans in strength, beauty and magic talent. They are also cruel and easily bored, and prefer sumptuous feasts and debauchery to studies and magical research. Cambion Kings lack morals and would readily abandon their troops or their god if threatened.
